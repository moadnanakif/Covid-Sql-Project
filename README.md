I have just completed  my first ever SQL and Power Bi Project to gain that initial confidence
and thought of sharing with you all.

Introduction:
> This Project is Deriving Insights from covid dataset.
> I have used SQL to extract, transform and analyze the data.
> The Insights gained from this is to find Total cases, Total Deaths, Infection Rate, 
  Total vaccinations Per Country and continent.
> I also examined relationships between Total Cases Vs Total deaths, Total population 
  Vs total cases,Total Cases Vs total vaccinations

Data:
> The Data is collected from Ourworldindata.org (And its pretty accurate i have checked its accuracy)
> The dataset contains 249691 records.         


Approach:
SQl:
> I divided data into two parts : 1.Cases part And 2. Vaccinations part.
> Then Imported data into postgresql : 
  Created Database As Sql_Covid_Project
  Created 2 tables : Covid_Cases And Covid_Vaccinations
  Inserted data using import feature and Copy Syntax
> Performed calculation to derive insights from that data.
> Such as Total cases, Total Deaths, Infection Rate, Death Rate
  Total vaccinations Per Country and continent.
> Overall Used Basic to advance sql to anlyse the data
Power Bi:
> Used Power Bi to visualize the data from sql analysis
> connected postgresql to powerbi and used advanced option to 
  bring final analysed dataset to powerbi
> build a dashboard that shows covid insights
